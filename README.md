# NoGym-RL
An RL exercise that doesn't require AI-Gym

Even though AI-Gym is great, it isn't (easily) available on windows.
Coupled with that, using the AI-Gym hides the detail of what is 
necessary to solve your own problems using RL.

I decided therefore to look at creating and solving simple problems 
without using AI-Gym, but following the same basic ideas encapsulated 
in their library.
